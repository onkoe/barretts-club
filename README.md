# Barrett's Club

A completely-custom theme for my website, [Barrett's Club](https://barretts.club)!

## Development

1. Before you can do anything, you'll need to install Zola. Follow the instructions [on their website](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).
1. Go ahead and `git clone` the repo!
1. Run `zola serve` and get to hacking!

**Bonus Tip**:

- Run this if you're on `fish`:

```console
$ zola completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/zola.fish
(no output)
```

## License

This project is dual-licensed under the wonderful Sam Hocevar's WTFPL and the lame-ass MIT license. You may pick either of these. Please see the LICENSE files in the repo for more information.

`SPDX-License-Identifier: WTFPL OR MIT`

Keep in mind that individual articles may be licensed differently. If so, a note will be included at the bottom of the article.

## Contributions

Feel free to PR if you notice any issues (or even if you want to contribute an article)! Otherwise, make an issue so I can take a look! :)
