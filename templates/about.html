            <span id="hi">Hi, I'm Barrett!</span> I'm an Indigenous student
            working towards my Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of
            Oklahoma!

        <p>
            My interests are wide-reaching and sometimes sporadic, as
            highlighted by this blog's broad span of topics. ADHD drives me to
            follow interesting things with dense subjects underneath, so you
            won't see me stop anytime soon. ðŸ˜„

        <p>
            Still, I've been captivated by the 
            <a href="{{get_url(path="tags/rust", trailing_slash=false)}}">
                Rust programming language
            </a>,
            embedded systems, and robotics for the past few years! I've
            published several Rust crates and guides on these subjects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Designing systems that make computers work well and feel pleasant is
            my passion.
