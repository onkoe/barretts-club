# Heading 1: Testing Your Zola Blog Theme

Welcome to the ultimate test post for your Zola blog theme. By the end of this post, you'll know exactly how to test **every nook and cranny** of your theme. Let's dive in! [^1]

## Heading 2: Text Formatting

First things first, let's test some basic text formatting options:

- **Bold Text**: Making sure this stands out.
- *Italic Text*: Adding a little emphasis.
- ***Bold and Italic***: Going all out with both.

### Heading 3: Blockquotes

Taking a break from all this worldly nonsense can be tough. Remember what my mom said:

> "Allocate a "power hour" in your day for tackling tasks you've been putting off. Choose a time when you're typically at your most energetic and alert. During this hour, focus solely on completing tasks you've been avoiding or find challenging. Eliminate distractions like social media and put your phone on "Do Not Disturb" mode. By concentrating your efforts, you'll make significant progress and create a positive cycle of achievement. It's a simple but effective way to build momentum and get things done!"

#### Heading 4: Ordered Lists

1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item

##### Heading 5: Unordered Lists

- Item One
- Item Two
- Item Three

###### Heading 6: Code Blocks

Let's test some code blocks in god's strongest programming language, Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Zola!");
}
```

And here's some weird shell output, using "cargo-run" as the language:

```cargo-run
$ cargo run --dev
Your Zola blog is now running!
```

## Heading 2: Tables and Definitions

Now let's move on to tables and definitions.

| Syntax | Description |
|---|---|
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |

## Heading 2: Strikethrough and Task Lists

~~The world is flat. We know better now.~~

- Write the press release
- Update the website
- Contact the media

## Heading 2: Emojis and Footnotes

That is so funny! :joy:

Here is a footnote. [^1]

Heading 2: ![im an image](https://placehold.co/4000x4000)

## By the way, let's make a really long header to test the table of contents and stress-test other systems ðŸ¤© This is so incredibly long that no one would ever dare take this much space up

[^1]: Here's the footnote text. Hope it shows up well!
