In the past, I've stuck to languages that are higher level - particularly Python and Java! There are many benefits that you get from using these languages! 

However, many languages obfuscate memory management - especially those that I know. Rust isn't like that, which is very confusing for newer users such as myself. 

To learn Rust, I've needed to dig deep into the ecosystem and understand how it's different from higher-level languages. The Rust documentation could work for many people, but in my view, it was hard to follow. 

I decided to look for other ways to learn the language. In the end, I found a pair of Microsoft tutorials that did the trick! (Yes, Microsoft tutorials!)

First, I went through Microsoft's *[Rust for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjbTjrchBwOVks_sr8EVW1x)* playlist. This series guides programmers with some experience through the syntax and quirks of the language. It feels like taking a college course, with one short lecture per topic, followed by a practice program that you write. 

I like this setup, as it let me go through lectures and take notes, then use my notes to make programs.

However, there's only so much information they can fit into a video series - even in thirty-five videos! To let people learn even more, Microsoft follows up with a Microsoft Training course. It's called *[Take your first steps with Rust](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/rust-first-steps)*, and it provides concise descriptions of Rust's dirty laundry (memory management). 

It follows a similar structure to the video series - but with longer explanations of Rust topics. I found it helpful to read the lecture documentation aloud, then take notes on the subjects I still didn't understand. Those topics would land me in the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example) book, which is official Rust documentation that works with other materials. It gives you more detailed examples of ambiguous concepts for beginners. 

With all these examples, I find it hard not to love Rust. It's an excellent language with some weird, novel syntax. In the end, most people should give it a try - even if they have to use Microsoft tutorials.
