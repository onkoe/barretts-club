When it comes to laptops, there are a lot of options. For me, a good laptop has:

- Good battery (80 Wh or higher)
- A 3:2/16:10 display with 350+ nits and a resolution of 1600p or higher
- 14-inch panel
- A power-efficient (Ryzen/ARM/Intel 13th-gen) processor
- The ability to run Linux natively

Sadly, I haven't found any laptops with all of these specs. Here are my current choices:

## Laptops

### Based on Tong-Fang's ID4H1

Several laptops on this list are based on some fancy Tong-Fang platform. They're all Intel but have specific adaptations according to the audience.

AMD adaptations existed in the past, particularly before the coronavirus.

#### [MALIBAL Aon S1](https://www.malibal.com/shop/laptops/aon-s1/)

- Battery: Perfect - 99 Wh.
- Display: Perfect - It's got a 16:10 aspect ratio at 1800p. 400 nits.
- Panel Size: Perfect - 14 inches.
- Processor: Intel Core i7 13700H WITH required NVIDIA RTX 3050. It's probably not great for Linux.
- Linux Support: Fully supported.

My main issues with this machine come from its internals. In particular, the required RTX card makes it a difficult sell.

#### [SLIMBOOK Executive 14"](https://slimbook.es/en/executive-en)

- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 400 nits. The resolution is at 1800p.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches.
- Processor: Not ideal. Uses an Intel chip - and an older i7 12700H at that. No RTX card is required, though!
- Linux support: YES!

I would love an AMD version of this machine in particular! The open-source community has a deep relationship with SLIMBOOK.

#### [SCHENKER Vision 15 (E22)](https://www.schenker-tech.de/en/schenker-vision-14-e22/)

- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 380 nits with a resolution of 1800p.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches.
- Processor: Not ideal. Uses that i7-13700H.
- Linux support: Unknown.

This machine is SCHENKER's generic version of the ID4H1. It has no notable differences from the others. You have to get it from a site called `bestware.com`. I also don't see an ANSI keyboard option. :p

SCHENKER left Linux support unmentioned on their website. That may be worth considering for manufacturer support.

#### [TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro 14 (Gen 8)](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-Gen8.tuxedo)

- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 1800p, with 400 nits of power!
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches!
- Processor: Not ideal. It also uses one of those darn Intel chips. (13700H)
- Linux support: YES!

So far, this is my favorite machine. A Ryzen version would be the perfect laptop, in my view. The Coreboot support is incredible!

However, the company does not offer ANSI (standard US) keyboard options. Bit annoying...

#### [SKIKK Green 5](https://www.skikk.eu/en/laptops/green)

- Battery: Perfect, at 99Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 16:10, 1800p, 400 nits.
- Panel Size: Perfect - 14 inches.
- Processor: 13700H ðŸ˜¶
- Linux support: Unknown.

This laptop is another generic example of the previous machines. However, they plant a tree when you buy a computer, so that's pretty cool. They also give you a choice of thermal paste during assembly - that's unique! I'd like to see a Ryzen processor and an ANSI keyboard for this to become the "prime option."

### [Star Labs StarFighter (16")](https://us.starlabs.systems/pages/starfighter)

- Battery: Great - 85 Wh.
- Display: Good, 16:10 at either UHD+ (2400p60) or 1600p165. Both panels run at around 600 nits.
- Panel Size: Not preferable - 16 inches is a bit too big for me.
- Processor: Wide range! There's a 15W i3-1315U (not an option due to 16GB memory limits), 15W i7-1355U, 45W i9-13800H, and 45W Ryzen 7 7840HS.
    - Of these options, I'd opt for the 1355U - a great Intel chip! :)
    - [This website](https://laptoping.com/cpus/product/intel-core-i7-1355u/) explains the 1355U's basics. I really would LOVE a Ryzen 7 7730U instead, though!
- Linux Support: DEFINITELY!

Star Labs also has a lot of goodwill from the open-source community. Their platform is entirely in-house, and I've heard great things about their machines! In case I can't find a 14" replacement for my current machine, I'll keep my eye on this one.

### [Apple MacBook Pro 14" (2021)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch)

- Battery: Good - 70 Wh.
- Display: Almost perfect! 500 nits, over 1600p, and a great aspect ratio of 16:10! The notch can get in the way of some applications.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14.2 inches.
- Processor: Perfect! The M1 Pro can run almost anything!
- Linux support: On-going work. Speakers don't work, graphics are mostly finished, and battery life is still a bit of a battle sometimes.

When [Asahi Linux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support) gets some of these Linux features completed, the MBP will be a great machine!

### [SCHENKER VIA 15 Pro](https://www.schenker-tech.de/en/schenker-via-15-pro-m22/)

- Battery: Perfect! 91 Wh.
- Display: Not ideal. 16:9 at 1440p. 300 nits is too dark in some outdoor settings.
- Panel size: Not ideal. 15 inches.
- Processor: Perfect! The 5700U is very efficient!
- Linux support: Yes!

While it's still 15 inches, this machine would be great with a better display.

### [Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-studio/8srdf62swkpf)

- Battery: Not ideal. 58 Wh.
- Display: Perfect! 3:2 at 1600p, with around 500 nits.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14.4 inches.
- Processor: Not ideal. The i5-11300H and i7-11370H are both quad-core processors. Power usage is nice, though!
- Linux support: Mostly works with lots of setup. Requires the use of [linux-surface](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Supported-Devices-and-Features) for any kind of good experience.

This machine has a great design, but some parts of the device are outdated or locked down. An updated version using common parts would be great!

### [Framework Laptop 13.5" (2023)](https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd)

- Battery: Not ideal. 55 or 61wh options only.
- Display: Perfect! 1504p at 3:2, running at over 400 nits.
- Panel size: Perfect! 13.5 inches.
- Processor: Perfect! Modern Ryzen processors are efficient and powerful.
- Linux support: Yes, officially supported!

I adore this machine in almost every way, but its battery is too small.

### [Framework Laptop 16" (2023)](https://frame.work/laptop-16)

- Battery: Great - 85 Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 1600p at 16:10, running at 500 nits.
- Panel size: Too big - 16 inches.
- Processor: Uses either the Ryzen 7 7840HS or the Ryzen 9 7940HS. Both are decent options but sit with a TDP of 45W, which is a bit high.
    - There is also a discrete GPU option with the RX 7700S. More Linux laptops with AMD GPUs, please!!! ðŸ¥°
- Linux support: Yes, these machines are effectively made for Linux!

I'd love one of these machines with a low-power Ryzen, such as the 7840U. Shaving some weight off would be nice - it's over 4 lbs.

### [ASUS Vivobook S 14X OLED](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/vivobook/vivobook-s-14x-oled-m5402-amd-ryzen-6000-series/)

- Battery: Good! 70Wh.
- Display: Perfect! 1800p at 16:10, running at 600 nits (!!!)
- Panel size: Perfect! 14.5 inches.
Processor: Great, but the beefier 6800H/HS, and especially the 6900HX, are way above anything I need. They may also take more power when running above idle than other efficient chips.
- Linux support: Yes! Or, at the very least, the M5402RAs running [here](https://linux-hardware.org/?view=computers&year=2022&type=Notebook&vendor=ASUSTek+Computer&model_like=VivoBook_ASUSLaptop&page=1) seem to be plenty happy...

I like this machine but want a version with a less beefy CPU.

### [ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED (UM3402)](https://www.asus.com/us/laptops/for-home/zenbook/zenbook-14-oled-um3402/where-to-buy/)

My friend got one of these, so you get a mini review!

- Display: It's a 16:10 panel at a resolution of 1800p90 - that's pretty good. It outputs 550 nits, which is excellent!
    - Unfortunately, the panel has these weird diagonal lines across the entire screen. It's particularly noticeable in darker colors, like deep purple or blue.
    - However, the color is GOOD - it looks better than my MBP 14" M1 Pro.
- Panel Size: Perfect - it's 14 inches.
- Processor: Pick between a Ryzen 5 7530U and a Ryzen 7 7730U - both will perform great!
    - WARNING: Limited to 16GB memory **max**!
- Linux Support: Needs some tweaks.
    - Using anything before kernel 6.5, your wireless drivers will act up often.
    - Some distros require an ACPI configuration file to get sound working. [Someone described the fixes needed here](https://github.com/farfaaa/asus_zenbook_UM3402YA#sound-fix)!
    - The number pad needs a driver to be enabled, but I don't think I'd want that.

### [LG Gram 17" (17Z90R-K.ADS9U1, 2023)](https://files.bbystatic.com/yRSJPxodWR42ufQ7kzs6xQ%3D%3D/Specification%2BSheet)

Woah, what a name! This LG Gram model is both huge and tiny. I'm considering picking one up due to its specs and battery, though I'm still waiting on more Linux-friendly hardware.

<ul>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="y", text="Battery")}}: 80 Wh </li>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Display")}}: 1600p at 350 nits! </li>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Panel size")}}: 17" (huge)! </li>
        <ul><li>However, it weighs 3 lb. There's not much of a weight trade-off here!</li></ul>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="y", text="Processor")}}: Intel's i7-1360P looks great, though its TDP is still a tad above competing Ryzen CPUs. </li>
        <ul><li>For example, the 7840U beats it in almost every way - and still uses less power!</li></ul>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="r", text="Linux support")}}: Ships with unsupported hardware. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The speakers don't seem to work due to the Realtek ALC298 codec chip [lacking Linux support from Realtek](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/2011385).</li>
            <li>
                There does appear to be [a janky workaround](https://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?331130-Fixing-ALC298-audio-(no-sound-from-speakers)), though I don't know how much
                I can recommend it personally. That linked repo's README warns of ["funny smells"](https://github.com/joshuagrisham/galaxy-book2-pro-linux/tree/main#sound) - that's a no from me..!
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

The [`16Z90R-K.ADB9U1`](https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=d3a9e05559) and [`14Z90RS-K.ADW9U1`](https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=154677) are much the same! I hope to see LG dropping this cursed audio chip in the future.

### [Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7630 (Iris, P125F004, 2023)](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-16-plus-laptop/spd/inspiron-16-7630-laptop/useichbts7630glcx)

I'd pick this machine up if it weren't so heavy. Even so, it's pretty alluring. See [its specification sheet here](https://dl.dell.com/content/manual26258980-inspiron-16-plus-7630-owner-s-manual-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-4050-and-intel-graphics.pdf?language=en-us).

<ul>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Battery")}}: 86 Wh. </li>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="y", text="Display")}}: 1600p at 300 nits. </li>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="y", text="Panel size")}}: 16 inches. </li>
        <ul><li>It's also 4.69 lb - a bit much...</li></ul>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Processor")}}: The i7-13700H more than I need, but since it's 13th gen, it's less concerning. Its TDP of 35W matches competing Ryzens. </li>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Linux support")}}: Many users online [report](https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/137ddzz/dell_inspiron_16_plus_7630/k45m2l1/) that it works without a hassle! </li>
</ul>

### [Lenovo ThinkPad P16s Gen 2 (AMD/Intel, 21K9001NUS/21HK0020US, 2023)](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p16s-gen-2-(16-inch-amd)-mobile-workstation/21k9001nus#reviews)

I'm pretty blown away by these little machines! If nothing else, they're in the running. Take a look at [their spec sheet here](https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/t14_gen4_p14s_gen4_t16_gen2_p16s_gen2_ug_en.pdf)!

<ul>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Battery")}}: 86 Wh. </li>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Display")}}: 2400p at 400 nits, with HDR 500 support! </li>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Panel size")}}: 16 inches. </li>
        <ul><li>Pretty lightweight at 3.76 lbs!</li></ul>
    <li> {{spec_color(c="g", text="Processor")}}: Comes with the speedy, reliable 7840U. Alternatively, you can get one with an i7-1360P. That's also a great choice! </li>
    <li>
        {{spec_color(c="g", text="Linux support")}}: While it's technically not 'officially' supported, Lenovo puts great care into choosing FOSS-friendly parts,

## Discontinued Machines

### [SLIMBOOK ProX 15"](https://slimbook.com/en/prox)

Unfortunately, this laptop has been left "out of stock with no availability date. In other words, SLIMBOOK has discontinued it!

Still, it has some excellent specs and fits the list reasonably well!

- Battery: Perfect - 97Wh!
- Display: A bit lower-spec'd. 1440p at 350 nits.
- Panel size: Not optimal - 15" is a tad too big.
- Processor: The 5700U is perfect for this use case!
- Linux support: Given that it's SLIMBOOK... yup! ðŸ˜„

## Conclusion

Do you see a laptop that fits these specs and isn't on the list? Let me know! :)
