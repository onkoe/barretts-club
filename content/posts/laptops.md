When it comes to laptops, there are a lot of options. For me, a good laptop has:

- Good battery (80 Wh or higher)
- A 3:2/16:10 display with 350+ nits and a resolution of 1600p or higher
- 14 inch panel
- A power efficient (Ryzen/ARM) processor
- The ability to run Linux natively

Sadly, I'm yet to find any laptops that have all of these specs. Here are my current choices:

## Laptops

### Based on Tong-Fang's ID4H1

Several of the laptops on this list are based on some fancy Tong-Fang platform. They're all Intel at the moment, but they all have certain adaptations according to audience.

AMD adaptations existed in the past, particularly before the coronavirus.

#### [MALIBAL Aon S1](https://www.malibal.com/shop/laptops/aon-s1/)

- Battery: Perfect - 99 Wh.
- Display: Perfect - It's got an 16:10 aspect ratio at 1800p. 400 nits.
- Panel Size: Perfect - 14 inches.
- Processor: Intel Core i7 13700H WITH required NVIDIA RTX 3050. Probably not great for Linux.
- Linux Support: Fully supported.

My main issues from this machine come from its internals. In particular, the required RTX card makes it a difficult sell.

#### [SLIMBOOK Executive 14"](https://slimbook.es/en/executive-en)

- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 400 nits. The resolution is at 1800p.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches.
- Processor: Not ideal. Uses an Intel chip, and an older i7 12700H at that. No RTX card required, though!
- Linux support: YES!

I would really like an AMD version of this machine in particular! SLIMBOOK is generally trusted in the open source community.

#### [SCHENKER Vision 15 (E22)](https://www.schenker-tech.de/en/schenker-vision-14-e22/)

- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 380 nits with a resolution of 1800p.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches.
- Processor: Not ideal. Uses that i7-13700H.
- Linux support: Unknown.

This is SCHENKER's generic version of the ID4H1. It really has no notable differences from the others. You have to get it from a site called `bestware.com`. I also don't see an ANSI keyboard option. :p

Linux support is not mentioned on their website.

#### [TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro 14 (Gen 8)](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-Gen8.tuxedo)

- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 1800p, with 400 nits of power!
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches!
- Processor: Not ideal. Also uses one of those darn Intel chips. (13700H)
- Linux support: YES!

So far, this is my favorite machine. A Ryzen version would be the perfect laptop in my view. The Coreboot support is awesome!

However, the company does not offer ANSI (standard US) options for your keyboard. Bit annoying...

### [Star Labs StarFighter (16")](https://us.starlabs.systems/pages/starfighter)

- Battery: Great - 85 Wh.
- Display: Good, 16:10 at either UHD+ (2400p60) or 1600p165. Both panels run at around 600 nits.
- Panel Size: Not preferable - 16 inches is a bit too big for me.
- Processor: Wide range! There's a 15W i3-1315U (not an option due to 16GB memory limits), 15W i7-1355U, 45W i9-13800H, and 45W Ryzen 7 7840HS.
  - Of these options, I think I'd opt for the 1355U - it's actually a great Intel chip! :)
  - [This website](https://laptoping.com/cpus/product/intel-core-i7-1355u/) explains the 1355U's basics. I really would LOVE a Ryzen 7 7730U instead, though!
- Linux Support: DEFINITELY!

Star Labs also has a lot of good will from the open source community. Their platform is made almost entirely in-house, and I've heard great things about their machines! In case I can't find a 14" replacement for my current machine, I'll keep my eye on this one.

### [Apple MacBook Pro 14" (2021)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch)

- Battery: Good - 70 Wh.
- Display: Almost perfect! 500 nits, over 1600p, and a great aspect ratio of 16:10! The notch can get in the way of some applications.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14.2 inches.
- Processor: Perfect! The M1 Pro can run almost anything!
- Linux support: On-going work. Speakers don't work, graphics are mostly finished, and battery life is still a bit of a battle sometimes.

When [Asahi Linux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support) gets some of these Linux features completed, the MBP will be a great machine!

### [SCHENKER VIA 15 Pro](https://www.schenker-tech.de/en/schenker-via-15-pro-m22/)

- Battery: Perfect! 91 Wh.
- Display: Not ideal. 16:9 at 1440p. 300 nits is too dark in some outdoor settings.
- Panel size: Not ideal. 15 inches.
- Processor: Perfect! The 5700U is very efficient!
- Linux support: Yes!

While it's still 15 inches, this machine would be great with a better display.

### [Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-studio/8srdf62swkpf)

- Battery: Not ideal. 58 Wh.
- Display: Perfect! 3:2 at 1600p, with around 500 nits.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14.4 inches.
- Processor: Not ideal. The i5-11300H and i7-11370H are both quad core processors. Power usage is nice, though!
- Linux support: Mostly works with lots of setup. Requires the use of [linux-surface](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Supported-Devices-and-Features) for any kind of good experience.

This machine has a great design, but some parts of the device are outdated or locked down. An updated version using common parts would be great!

### [Framework Laptop 13.5" (2023)](https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd)

- Battery: Not ideal. 55 or 61wh options only.
- Display: Perfect! 1504p at 3:2, running at over 400 nits.
- Panel size: Perfect! 13.5 inches.
- Processor: Perfect! Modern Ryzen processors are efficient and powerful.
- Linux support: Yes, officially supported!

I adore this machine in almost every way, but its battery is too small.

### [Framework Laptop 16" (2023)](https://frame.work/laptop-16)

- Battery: Great - 85 Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 1600p at 16:10, running at 500 nits.
- Panel size: Too big - 16 inches.
- Processor: Uses either the Ryzen 7 7840HS or Ryzen 9 7940HS. Both are decent options, but sit with a TDP of 45W - a bit high.
  - There is also a discrete GPU option with the RX 7700S. More Linux laptops with AMD GPUs, please!!! ðŸ¥°
- Linux support: Yes, these machines are effectively made for Linux!

I'd love one of these machines with a low-power Ryzen, such as the 7840U. Shaving some weight off would be nice - it's over 4 lb as-is.

### [ASUS Vivobook S 14X OLED](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/vivobook/vivobook-s-14x-oled-m5402-amd-ryzen-6000-series/)

- Battery: Good! 70Wh.
- Display: Perfect! 1800p at 16:10, running at 600 nits (!!!)
- Panel size: Perfect! 14.5 inches.
- Processor: Great, but the beefier 6800H/HS and especially the 6900HX are way above anything I need. They may also take more power when running above idle than other efficient chips.
- Linux support: Yes! Or at the very least, the M5402RAs running [here](https://linux-hardware.org/?view=computers&year=2022&type=Notebook&vendor=ASUSTek+Computer&model_like=VivoBook_ASUSLaptop&page=1) seem to be plenty happy...

I like this machine, but I'd like to see a version with a less beefy CPU.

### [ASUS Zenbook 14 OED (UM3402)](https://www.asus.com/us/laptops/for-home/zenbook/zenbook-14-oled-um3402/where-to-buy/)

My friend got one of these, so you get a mini review!

- Display: It's a 16:10 panel at a resolution of 1800p90 - that's pretty good. It outputs 550 nits, which is great!
  - Unfortunately, the panel has these weird diagonal lines across the entire screen. It's particularly noticable on darker color, like a deep purple or blue.
  - However, the color is REALLY GOOD - it looks better than my MBP 14" M1 Pro.
- Panel Size: Perfect - it's 14 inches.
- Processor: Pick between a Ryzen 5 7530U and Ryzen 7 7730U - both will perform great!
  - WARNING: Limited to 16GB memory **max**!
- Linux Support: Everything just works (Â©) after you update the kernel to something around 6.5. Before that, expect the weird-ass MediaTek wi-fi card to act up a bit.

## Conclusion

Do you see a laptop that fits these specs and isn't on the list? Let me know! :)
